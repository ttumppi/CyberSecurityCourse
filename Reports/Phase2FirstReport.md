## Alert Detail



### [ Cloud Metadata Potentially Exposed ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/90034/)



##### High (Low)

### Description

The Cloud Metadata Attack attempts to abuse a misconfigured NGINX server in order to access the instance metadata maintained by cloud service providers such as AWS, GCP and Azure.
All of these providers provide metadata via an internal unroutable IP address '169.254.169.254' - this can be exposed by incorrectly configured NGINX servers and accessed by using this IP address in the Host header field.

* URL: http://localhost:8000/latest/meta-data/
  * Method: `POST`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: `169.254.169.254`
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `Based on the successful response status code cloud metadata may have been returned in the response. Check the response data to see if any cloud metadata has been returned.
The meta data returned can include information that would allow an attacker to completely compromise the system.`

Instances: 1

### Solution

Do not trust any user data in NGINX configs. In this case it is probably the use of the $host variable which is set from the 'Host' header and can be controlled by an attacker.

### [ CSP: Wildcard Directive ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10055/)



##### Medium (High)

### Description

Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks. Including (but not limited to) Cross Site Scripting (XSS), and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.

* URL: http://localhost:8000
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `content-security-policy`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self';`
  * Other Info: `The following directives either allow wildcard sources (or ancestors), are not defined, or are overly broadly defined:
frame-ancestors, form-action

The directive(s): frame-ancestors, form-action are among the directives that do not fallback to default-src, missing/excluding them is the same as allowing anything.`

Instances: 6

### Solution

Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is properly configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.

#### WASC Id: 15

#### Source ID: 3

### [ Cookie No HttpOnly Flag ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10010/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

A cookie has been set without the HttpOnly flag, which means that the cookie can be accessed by JavaScript. If a malicious script can be run on this page then the cookie will be accessible and can be transmitted to another site. If this is a session cookie then session hijacking may be possible.

* URL: http://localhost:8000/login
  * Method: `POST`
  * Parameter: `Authorization`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `set-cookie: Authorization`
  * Other Info: ``

Instances: 1

### Solution

Ensure that the HttpOnly flag is set for all cookies.

#### WASC Id: 13

#### Source ID: 3

### [ Cookie without SameSite Attribute ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10054/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

A cookie has been set without the SameSite attribute, which means that the cookie can be sent as a result of a 'cross-site' request. The SameSite attribute is an effective counter measure to cross-site request forgery, cross-site script inclusion, and timing attacks.

* URL: http://localhost:8000/login
  * Method: `POST`
  * Parameter: `Authorization`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `set-cookie: Authorization`
  * Other Info: ``

Instances: 1

### Solution

Ensure that the SameSite attribute is set to either 'lax' or ideally 'strict' for all cookies.

#### CWE Id: [ 1275 ](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1275.html)


#### WASC Id: 13

#### Source ID: 3

### [ X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10021/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to 'nosniff'. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.

* URL: http://localhost:8000/robots.txt
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `x-content-type-options`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `This issue still applies to error type pages (401, 403, 500, etc.) as those pages are often still affected by injection issues, in which case there is still concern for browsers sniffing pages away from their actual content type.
At "High" threshold this scan rule will not alert on client or server error responses.`
* URL: http://localhost:8000/sitemap.xml
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `x-content-type-options`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `This issue still applies to error type pages (401, 403, 500, etc.) as those pages are often still affected by injection issues, in which case there is still concern for browsers sniffing pages away from their actual content type.
At "High" threshold this scan rule will not alert on client or server error responses.`
* URL: http://localhost:8000/styles
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `x-content-type-options`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `This issue still applies to error type pages (401, 403, 500, etc.) as those pages are often still affected by injection issues, in which case there is still concern for browsers sniffing pages away from their actual content type.
At "High" threshold this scan rule will not alert on client or server error responses.`

Instances: 3

### Solution

Ensure that the application/web server sets the Content-Type header appropriately, and that it sets the X-Content-Type-Options header to 'nosniff' for all web pages.
If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that does not perform MIME-sniffing at all, or that can be directed by the web application/web server to not perform MIME-sniffing.

### [ Authentication Request Identified ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10111/)



##### Informational (High)

### Description

The given request has been identified as an authentication request. The 'Other Info' field contains a set of key=value lines which identify any relevant fields. If the request is in a context which has an Authentication Method set to "Auto-Detect" then this rule will change the authentication to match the request identified.

* URL: http://localhost:8000/login
  * Method: `POST`
  * Parameter: `username`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `password`
  * Other Info: `userParam=username
userValue=ZAP
passwordParam=password
referer=http://localhost:8000/login`

Instances: 1

### Solution

This is an informational alert rather than a vulnerability and so there is nothing to fix.

### [ Loosely Scoped Cookie ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/90033/)



##### Informational (Low)

### Description

Cookies can be scoped by domain or path. This check is only concerned with domain scope.The domain scope applied to a cookie determines which domains can access it. For example, a cookie can be scoped strictly to a subdomain e.g. www.nottrusted.com, or loosely scoped to a parent domain e.g. nottrusted.com. In the latter case, any subdomain of nottrusted.com can access the cookie. Loosely scoped cookies are common in mega-applications like google.com and live.com. Cookies set from a subdomain like app.foo.bar are transmitted only to that domain by the browser. However, cookies scoped to a parent-level domain may be transmitted to the parent, or any subdomain of the parent.

* URL: http://localhost:8000/login
  * Method: `POST`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `The origin domain used for comparison was:
localhost
Authorization=Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6IlpBUCIsImV4cCI6MTczMjgyMTA4N30.iER6HT7YKTcz_JrsYwD8HIrfehj2-hP5G5fBMlJJ46b7rG_KgJH5vIie9hiIjK8ff7DGk1knxpI5I9a23ycm4A
`

Instances: 1

### Solution

Always scope cookies to a FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name).
